# Vim + Readline = \<THIS!!!\>

I love [Vim]().
I love [Readline]().

Why am I always exiting from insert mode? Because I don't know the [insert modes special keys](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html).

Why are those special keys so different from Readline?

Some might say that I should be using Emacs; but I'm a Vim Man. I say, READLINE IN INSERT MODE!

Together, lets make it happen!

## Call To Action

I've scraped together all the commands that Readline supports and put together the framework to fill in. Some of the commands will not be relevant for Vim but I've left them in for the sake of completion.

- [Changing Text](./plugin/changing_text.vim)
- [Killing & Yanking](./plugin/killing_yanking.vim)
- [Macros](./plugin/macros.vim)
- [Miscellaneous](./plugin/misc.vim)
- [Movement](./plugin/movement.vim)
- [Typing For You](./plugin/type_for_you.vim)


## Installation

Use whatever plugin manager you like (I like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vi://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim))
